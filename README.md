## Model
The model architecture:

<img src='imgs/model.png'/>


The model results in about 85.5% in the train set and 84.4% accuracy on the test set, which has 160000 tweets; therefore, there is no over-fitting here.

## Run
First we need to install the requirements with: 
```sh
 pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
### Straming
Start kafka with:
```sh
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
```

then create a kafka topic (tweets_stream) with:
```sh
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic tweets_stream
```
